        "Choice": "Rock",
        "Reason": "Given that there is no history of user choices, there is no pattern to base a prediction on. Playing 'Rock' as the first move is a balanced and strategic choice to counter randomness."
    },
    {
        "Choice": "Rock",
        "Reason": "Since the user's previous choices aren't provided for analysis, I will make a rational decision. Choosing Rock counters the user's possible Scissors, which is a common starting choice in such games. This increases the likelihood of winning."
    },
    {
        "Choice": "Rock",
        "Reason": "Without any sample history provided to analyze the user's patterns, I chose Rock as a general starting move. It is a balanced initial move, and the user might not expect it."
    },
    {
        "Choice": "Rock",
        "Reason": "In the first round, the user chose scissors, which loses to rock. It's possible they might try to counter my rock by choosing paper this time. However, a common strategy after losing is to repeat the same choice or switch to the strongest counter. To anticipate both potential scissors (if repeated) and paper (if they counter), I'll stick with rock to maintain stability and potentially catch the user off guard."
    },
    {
        "Choice": "Scissors",
        "Reason": "In the first round, the user played scissors, and in the second round, they switched to paper. The shift might indicate a preference for alternating strategies or cycling through options. To counteract this potential cycle, I chose scissors, anticipating the user might return to paper or play rock."
    },
    {
        "Choice": "Scissors",
        "Reason": "Analyzing the user's past choices, they have selected scissors twice and paper once. This might suggest a preference for scissors or alternating patterns. By choosing scissors again, the user could be repeating their earlier choice, so I'll counter this potential repeat situation. Scissors also hold potential in a draw scenario, which maintains strategic flexibility."
    },
    {
        "Choice": "Scissors",
        "Reason": "The user has alternated between their choices (scissors, paper, scissors, rock). If this pattern continues, their next choice might return to paper. I chose scissors to counter their most likely move, paper."
